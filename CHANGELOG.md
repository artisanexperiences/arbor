## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- Output capture for scaffold steps with `store_as` option
  - Capture command output from `bash.run`, `command.run`, and all binary steps
  - Store output as template variables for use in subsequent steps
  - Automatic whitespace trimming of captured output
  - Works with: `php`, `php.composer`, `php.laravel.artisan`, `node.npm`, `node.yarn`, `node.pnpm`, `node.bun`, `herd`

### Example
```yaml
scaffold:
  steps:
    # Capture Laravel version
    - name: php.laravel.artisan
      args: ["--version"]
      store_as: LaravelVersion
    
    # Store in .env
    - name: env.write
      key: APP_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
      value: "{{ .LaravelVersion }}"
```

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- Database naming now uses sanitized site name to handle hyphenated branch names correctly
- Laravel preset writes DB_DATABASE to .env after database creation to ensure migrations run against correct database
- Default branch worktrees now use saved SiteName instead of folder name to prevent Herd link collisions
- Scaffold command now correctly detects when running from project root vs worktree
- env.write step race conditions resolved with file locking for concurrent execution
- env.write now respects configured priority and creates parent directories as needed

### Changed
- Removed priority system in favor of sequential step execution for predictable ordering
- Steps now execute in the exact order they appear in configuration

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

- Built-in template variables: Path, RepoPath, RepoName, SiteName, Branch, DbSuffix, SanitizedSiteName
- Custom variables from env.read steps available to subsequent steps
- Support for multiple databases with shared suffix generation
- DatabaseClient abstraction with mock support for testing
- Readable database name generation using adjective_noun word lists
- Automatic retry on database name collisions (up to 5 attempts)
- Persistent suffix storage in worktree-local config for cleanup
- Support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite

### Improved
- Mock implementations for database operations eliminate need for containerized tests
- Improved test coverage across scaffold steps
