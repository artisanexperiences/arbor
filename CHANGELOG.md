## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- New `arbor repair` command for fixing git configuration in existing projects
  - Configure fetch refspec in `.bare` directory for remote branch tracking
  - Automatically set up branch tracking for all local branches with remote counterparts
  - Interactive prompts for remote URL confirmation and editing
  - `--dry-run` flag to preview changes without applying
  - `--refspec-only` and `--tracking-only` flags for partial repairs
  - Idempotent - safe to run multiple times

- Automatic branch tracking in `arbor work` command
  - New worktrees automatically set up upstream tracking to origin
  - `--no-track` flag to skip tracking setup when needed
  - Non-fatal errors - worktree creation continues even if tracking fails

- Automatic fetch refspec configuration in `arbor init`
  - Bare repositories now automatically configured for remote tracking
  - Enables fetch, merge, and rebase operations from remote branches

- New git helper functions for remote and branch management
  - `ConfigureFetchRefspec()` - Set up remote.origin.url and fetch refspec
  - `SetBranchUpstream()` - Configure branch tracking
  - `GetBranchRefs()` - List local and remote branches
  - `HasFetchRefspec()` and `HasBranchTracking()` - Check configuration state

### Fixed

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- ARM64 architecture support for release binaries (macOS ARM64, Linux ARM64)
- Checksum generation for all release artifacts (SHA256)
- Reproducible builds with version information embedded in binary

### Fixed
- Resolve golangci-lint v2 errors

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- Output capture for scaffold steps with `store_as` option
  - Capture command output from `bash.run`, `command.run`, and all binary steps
  - Store output as template variables for use in subsequent steps
  - Automatic whitespace trimming of captured output

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- Database naming now uses sanitized site name to handle hyphenated branch names correctly
- Laravel preset writes DB_DATABASE to .env after database creation to ensure migrations run against correct database
- Default branch worktrees now use saved SiteName instead of folder name to prevent Herd link collisions
- Scaffold command now correctly detects when running from project root vs worktree
- env.write step race conditions resolved with file locking for concurrent execution
- env.write now respects configured priority and creates parent directories as needed

### Changed
- Removed priority system in favor of sequential step execution for predictable ordering
- Steps now execute in the exact order they appear in configuration

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- New scaffold steps: env.read, env.write, db.create, db.destroy

- Built-in template variables: Path, RepoPath, RepoName, SiteName, Branch, DbSuffix, SanitizedSiteName
- Custom variables from env.read steps available to subsequent steps
- Support for multiple databases with shared suffix generation
- DatabaseClient abstraction with mock support for testing
- Readable database name generation using adjective_noun word lists
- Automatic retry on database name collisions (up to 5 attempts)
